### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I don't use a lot GitHub, i prefer GitLab; here's my [GitLab's profile](https://gitlab.com/myasnik) and [GitLab's hugo website](https://myasnik.gitlab.io/), take a look at them!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying Cubersecuirty at Sapienza University of Rome.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning binary exploitation, red team, blue team and hardware hacking!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, probably I will answer you even if I don't know the answer (that happens most of the time! AHAHAH)
